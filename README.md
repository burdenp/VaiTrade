# VaiTrade.
A test problem for Vai Trade written in python.
This problem is all written in 1 file including tests. This is for simplicity sake rather than to represent a real development environment.
This problem is left in debug/test mode rather than being in the setting for production deployment so that tests can be run and my solution can be verified.
Tests are included in the file towards the end.
The file is not as clean as I would like due to the tests being included in with the file.
This can be functionally tested by running it as a python script and sending post requests through your favorite tool, such as postman.
Thank you for your consideration.
